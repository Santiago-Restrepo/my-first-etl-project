# My First ETL Project

This is my first ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project, where I am building a data pipeline to extract data from Trip Advisor reviews and offerings using [this Kaggle dataset in CSV format](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/hotel-reviews?select=reviews.csv). The project processes and transforms data using Pandas and brings data into a PostgreSQL database using SqlAlchemy.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Santiago-Restrepo/my-first-etl-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-first-etl-project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Setup

For the project, I use Docker and Docker Compose to set up the PostgreSQL database. Follow these steps to run the database:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already. You can download them from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. In the project directory, create a `.env` file with the following database configuration:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres123
   POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
   POSTGRES_PORT=5434
   ```

3. Run the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Setting Up Datasets

Before running this project, you'll need to create a `datasets` folder and place the necessary CSV files from the Kaggle dataset inside it. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `datasets` folder in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir datasets
   ```

2. Download the following CSV files from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/hotel-reviews?select=reviews.csv):

   - `reviews.csv`
   - `offerings.csv`

3. Place the downloaded CSV files into the `datasets` folder.

## Running the Project

Now that the database is set up, you can run the ETL project:

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated (see [Installation](#installation)).

2. Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will start the ETL process and populate the PostgreSQL database with the extracted and transformed data.

Feel free to explore the code in the `main.py` and other relevant files for more details on the ETL process.

🥷 Happy ninja coding!
